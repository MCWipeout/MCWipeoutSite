The production of Season 3 is well underway, and we have finally announced the official dates for this season!

S3 will feature 3 identical qualifier rounds. Each team will choose 1 date to play on, and they will play 3 brand new maps. After all 3 days are complete, the best times across all 3 maps from all 3 days will be chosen to proceed to the finale!

## ‚è∞ The Dates:

Friday 3rd of November, at 7am

Friday 3rd of November, at 2pm

Saturday 4th of November, at 5pm

*All times shown in EST, you can view them in your timezone at the [front page](https://www.mcwipeout.com/)*

*The events take place after the upcoming Australia/Europe day light savings, so these times may be slightly inacurate until this happens!*
